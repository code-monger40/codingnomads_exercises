# Think about a task that you want to accomplish using programming
# Maybe you want to automate something you do every day on your computer?
# Break down some of the steps you can think of and write them in
# this file as pseudocode.
# You can come back and update this file when you've learned more.
# You can also add real Python code after learning the necessary concepts.
# For now, just practice breaking larger tasks into smaller steps
# and writing out your thoughts in pseudocode.

# Psuedocode example
# Compare a list of IP addresses from two spreadsheets
# Pull IP addresses from spreadsheet one
# Pull IP addresses from spreaadsheet two
# If IP from spreadsheet 1 matches IP from spreadsheet 2 send to new spreadsheet
# If IP from spreesheet is not found in spreadsheet 2 do nothing
